    Yardstick TC072 config file;
    Measure network throughput and packet loss using pktgen;
    Different amounts of flows are tested with, from 2 up to 1001000;
    All tests are run 2 times each. First 2 times with the least
    amount of ports, then 2 times with the next amount of ports,
    and so on until all packet sizes have been run with;
    During the measurements network usage statistics and network latency are
    recorded/measured using sar and ping, respectively;

  type: Ping
  run_in_background: true

  options:
    packetsize: 100
